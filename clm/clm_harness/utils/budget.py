"""Shared context-budget mechanism for the clm harnesses.

ONE place for the context-limit policy every harness uses, so all harnesses
behave identically:

  * DETERMINISTIC gate — budget decisions use a local tiktoken count
    (``tokens.count_tokens``), never a provider-calibrated estimate (the gateway's
    ``usage.prompt_tokens`` is unreliable).
  * NO mechanical truncation — when the retained context crosses ``budget - reserve``
    it is a context-limit EVENT: the model gets ONE final turn (submit / write the
    required output), then the run stops and the sandbox is graded as-is. The model
    can rescue itself by getting back under budget on that turn (state re-arms).
  * Optional ROLL BACK AND RETRY (``max_num_retry_on_limit`` > 0): on overflow, drop the
    newest turns until there is room to compact in, then demand a compaction — repeatedly
    — instead of ending the run. Rolled-back turns leave the message log for good, so the
    final trajectory only shows the surviving context plus a retry count.
  * Escalating proactive NUDGES at configurable budget fractions (each fires once,
    re-arms if the model compacts back below it). Harnesses that cannot compact
    (e.g. the plain baseline) simply pass ``nudge_ratios=[]``.
  * Newest-output CAP so a single large tool observation cannot blow the budget.

Usage per turn::

    dec = controller.evaluate(messages)
    messages.extend(dec.messages)          # nudge and/or final-turn notice
    if dec.log:
        timing_log.append({"step": step + 1, **dec.log})
    if dec.action == "stop":
        break                              # final turn already taken -> grade as-is
