"""Context-management utilities for clm_harness.

Modules (import the leaf directly; this package file stays import-light):
* ``context_string`` — render the message log to an editable string and map an
                       arbitrarily-edited string back to a legal message list
                       (``render_editable`` / ``parse_back``).
