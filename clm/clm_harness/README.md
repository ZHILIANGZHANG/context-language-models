# clm_harness

The CLM agent for [Harbor](https://github.com/laude-institute/harbor). `ClmAgent` gives the
model one `bash` tool and lets it manage its own context by editing a file.

## How a turn works

1. **Mirror.** Before each command, the harness writes the model's editable context to
   `/tmp/.live_ctx/LIVE_CTX_MAIN.txt` in the sandbox. This is every turn after the system
   prompt and the task, one `[[CTX_TURN i role=…]]` block per message.
2. **Budget check.** The harness counts the tokens of the next request.
   - It adds a nudge when the context crosses 25%, 50% or 75% of the budget.
   - It adds an urgent nudge on every turn when the room left is too small for the next
     output (`persistent_nudge_ratio`).
   - Above the limit (budget minus reserve), it rolls back the newest turns and asks the
     model to condense (`max_num_retry_on_limit`).
3. **Command.** The model runs one bash command. To compact, it edits the mirror with
   ordinary tools such as `sed`, `python3` or `cat >`.
4. **Read back.** If the file changed, the harness parses it back into a valid message list.
   The system prompt and the task stay pinned. The edit gate decides whether to accept the
   edit, and the model gets a one-line receipt. A turn that only edits the mirror and prints
   nothing does not count as a task step.
5. **Finish.** Near the step or LM-call limit, the model is told to write its final
   output. The run ends on the submit command (`finish_policy: submit`), at the limits, or
   when the context is still over budget after the final turn.

## Layout

| directory | contents |
|---|---|
| [`clm_agent/`](clm_agent/) | `ClmAgent`, the agent loop, and its system prompt |
| [`context_env/`](context_env/) | the context file: writing it to the sandbox, reading edits back, the edit gate |
| [`context_utils/`](context_utils/) | rendering the context to text and parsing an edited file back into messages |
| [`utils/`](utils/) | token budget (nudges, rollback-and-retry, final turn), finish policies, token counting, checkpoint and resume, skill mounting |
| [`configs/`](configs/) | configs used for zero-shot evaluation |
| [`task_templates/`](task_templates/) | how the task is presented to the model |
| [`agent_trajectory_format/`](agent_trajectory_format/) | ATIF-CTX, our extension of Harbor's [ATIF](https://docs.harborframework.com/core-concepts/agents/atif) that records intermediate context segments and multi-agent sub-trajectories |
| [`flops_metrics/`](flops_metrics/) | inference FLOPs with prefix-cache reuse |

## Outputs

Each trial's agent log directory holds these files:

- `trajectory.json`
- `usage.json` (steps, LM calls, edits, nudges, retries, cost)
- `timing.json`
- per-call `context_snapshots/`
- `trajectory.ctx.json`

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/context-language-models.git && cd context-language-models
python3.12 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .            # harbor==0.16.1, litellm, tiktoken, pyyaml
```

## Run with Harbor

After `pip install -e .`, the `clm-harbor` command is the Harbor CLI with CLM available as
`-a clm-minimal`. All other arguments go to Harbor unchanged:

```bash
clm-harbor run -p path/to/task -a clm-minimal -m openai/qwen36-27b \
  --agent-kwarg api_base=http://localhost:8000/v1
clm-harbor trial start -p path/to/task -e docker -a clm-minimal -m openai/qwen36-27b \
  --agent-kwarg api_base=http://localhost:8000/v1 --clm-config bcp
```

- `--clm-config bcp|edgebench|<path.yaml>` expands a config into `--agent-kwarg` flags;
  explicit `--agent-kwarg` values take precedence.
- Unless given, `context_budget_tokens=32000` and `cost_metric=usd` are added.
- With plain `harbor`, the same agent is `-a clm_harness.clm_agent.harness:ClmAgent`.

### Example script and configs

[`clm/examples/run_harbor.sh`](../examples/run_harbor.sh) runs one trial on any Harbor task directory. It can also expand one
of the configs in [`configs/`](configs/) into `--agent-kwarg` flags:

```bash
export API_BASE=http://localhost:8000/v1   # OpenAI-compatible endpoint
export MODEL=openai/qwen36-27b             # litellm model name (openai/<served name>)
clm/examples/run_harbor.sh path/to/task              # class defaults, 32000-token budget
clm/examples/run_harbor.sh path/to/task bcp          # BrowseComp-Plus settings
clm/examples/run_harbor.sh path/to/task edgebench    # EdgeBench settings
HARBOR_ENV=singularity clm/examples/run_harbor.sh path/to/task bcp --trial-name t1
```

Arguments after the config are passed to `harbor trial start`. See the header of the script
for the other environment variables.

| config | used for | notable settings |
|---|---|---|
| `configs/bcp.yaml` | BrowseComp-Plus (deep research) | 28672-token budget, 500 task steps (100 and 2000 were also used), 60k-char observations, persistent 90% nudge, 6 rollback retries, shrink edit gate |
| `configs/edgebench.yaml` | EdgeBench (long-horizon improvement) | 32000-token budget, no step limit in practice, no finish command (`finish_policy: open_ended`), no persistent nudge, 50 retries, hourly checkpoints, EdgeBench finalize message |

A config is a YAML file with `agent_kwargs` (passed as `--agent-kwarg`) and `env` (exported
before Harbor starts).

### Key settings

| kwarg | default | what it does |
|---|---|---|
| `context_budget_tokens` | required | Token budget for the context. The enforced limit is the budget minus `context_budget_reserve_tokens` (2048). |
| `max_num_retry_on_limit` | 50 | Rollback-retry. When the context crosses the limit, the newest turns are rolled back until `retry_edit_margin_tokens` (2048) are free. The model is then told to compact, and a pinned note lists the commands whose output overflowed. Once N retries are used up, an overflow gives the model one final turn, and the run stops if the context is still over the limit on the next turn. `0` skips the retries. |
| `nudge_ratios` | `0.25,0.5,0.75` | Budget fractions at which the model gets an escalating reminder to compact. Each fires once and re-arms after the context shrinks. |
| `persistent_nudge_ratio` | `adaptive` | Urgent nudge, repeated on every turn near the limit. `adaptive` fires while the room left is below max(10% of the limit, `persistent_nudge_obs_mult` (default 2) × the largest of the last 3 tool outputs), and never below 50% of the limit. With small outputs it behaves like a 90% threshold; with outputs that are large relative to the budget it fires early enough to compact before a single output overflows. A number (e.g. `0.9`) uses a fixed fraction of the limit; `none` turns it off. |
| `max_steps` | 64 | Task-step budget. A turn that only edits the context (mirror changed, no output, exit 0) is free. |
| `lm_call_cap` | `2*max_steps+24` | Cap on the main agent's LM calls. Free context-editing turns still count here. `0` disables it. |
| `finalize_nudge_turns`, `finalize_message` | 3, none | In the last N turns, a notice tells the model to write its final output and submit. The count uses whichever runs out first, task steps or LM calls under the cap (`finalize_on_lm_call_cap`, default on). `finalize_message` is appended to the notice. |
| `allow_edit_growth` / `CLM_EDIT_GATE` | fit | Edit gate. `fit` accepts an edit if the result fits the limit. `shrink` accepts it only if the context gets smaller. Both take `fit` or `shrink`; the kwarg also takes `true` (fit) or `false` (shrink). A rejected edit is not applied, and the model is told why. The kwarg overrides the env var. |
| `finish_policy` | `submit` | `submit`: the model ends the run with `echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT`. `open_ended`: there is no finish command. |
| `task_template` | `terminal_agent_tasks` | How the task is presented: `terminal_agent_tasks`, `open_problems` (the instruction as is), or `edgebench`. |
| `temperature`, `top_p`, `max_tokens` | 0.7, 0.95, 16384 | Sampling. Pass `none` to omit `temperature` or `top_p`. |
| `cost_metric`, `flops_model_key` | auto | `usd` for priced API models. For local models, use `flops` with a model key (`9b` or `27b`) or `flops_n_body`. With `auto` (the default) the agent needs a FLOPs model size and refuses to start without one, whatever the model; pass `cost_metric=usd` to skip FLOPs accounting. The example script passes `usd` when no config sets it. |

### Serving

Any OpenAI-compatible server works; tool calling must be enabled. For Qwen with vLLM:

```bash
vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B --served-model-name qwen36-27b --max-model-len 65536 \
  --enable-auto-tool-choice --tool-call-parser qwen3_coder --reasoning-parser qwen3
```

The server's context window must hold `context_budget_tokens + max_tokens`. For API models,
pass the litellm model name (e.g. `anthropic/...`) and leave `api_base` unset.
